Description:
    After context switch in task_switch(change esp, ebp), the local parameter 
    next_task no longer the same value as before and as a ptr, page fault occurs.
Reason:
 	after changing esp ebp, the local parameter which stores on the kernel stack has 
    changed due to different kernel stack, therefore should not be used again.
Solution:
    put next_task before doing context switch.

Description:
    page fault after openning second terminal.
Reason:
 	We call system_execute in terminal_switch, which is in keyboard handler, therefore the stack is 
    pushed up because we did not return from keyboard handler.
Solution:
    We start new terminal and call system_execute in pit handler, which work correctly switching between 
    top of pit handler.

Description:
    After open three fish program and back to terminal 1, when three programs all terminated, 
    the first terminal is restarted two times.
Reason:
 	In system_halt, the number of tasks for each terminal should be decremented according to which task is running
    not which terminal is currently on .
Solution:
    We change curr_terminal->num_task-- to curr_task()->terminal->num_task--.

Solution:
    After receiving release interrupt of enter, reset enter flag to 0.
